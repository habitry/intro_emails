#A convenient lie.

_On Valentine's Day February 2007, I didn't recognize the person in the mirror. That person was 60lbs overweight, completely sedentary, and not the person that my parter had married. It wasn't me. But I didn't know where I was anymore underneath all that. So I put on running shoes, set out to run a mile, and made it a block before I threw up. And the next day, I did it again..._

If what you're expecting next is a story of personal sacrifice, determination, and willpower, then you have been told a very convenient lie that has trapped you into a cycle of inaction, guilt, extremes, and self-loathing, only to remain exactly where you are.

*This is not how behavior change works.*
