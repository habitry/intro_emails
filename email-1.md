##A convenient lie.

_On Valentine's Day February 2007, I didn't recognize the person in the mirror. That person was 60lbs overweight, completely sedentary, and not the person that my parter had married. It wasn't me. But I didn't know where I was anymore underneath all that. So I put on running shoes, set out to run a mile, and made it a block before I threw up. And the next day, I did it again..._

If what you're expecting next is a story of personal sacrifice, determination, and willpower, then you have been told a very convenient lie that has trapped you into a cycle of inaction, guilt, extremes, and self-loathing, only to remain exactly where you are.

**This is not how behavior change works.**

##The truth as old as humans

According to 60 years of research on motivation and habit-formation, the most common, positive way that human beings change their behavior is by subtle changes to their physical and social environment designed to keep them focused on the process of mastery until new habits are formed.

The reality is, people rarely change themselves.
Communities with a shared mission change us all the time, without us even noticing.
The most foundational frameworks in social science back this up:

- Social Cognitive Theory: Humans learn almost all behavior from modeling others, including confidence! 
- Self-Determination Theory: We feel the most motivated when supported and accountable to others who share our values.
- Habit-Formation: habits form by repetition in context, which means putting in the necessary reps in an environment that supports our desired behavior.
- Ego-depletion: Willpower is a limited resource that gets used up throughout the day, but habits do not use up this resource.

The resulting, evidence-based model for how to permanently and effectively change human behavior is simple, but challenging in a way that most of us are simply not used to being challenged. 

###Join a community that will help you stay focused on the process for long enough that it will actually work.###

Think about it: Alcoholics Anonymous, the Marine Corps, every world religion, even the scientific community and democracy itself have a very simple way of transforming behavior: **help people stay focused on the process, not the outcome.**

In fact, I believe if you look at the entirety of human history, this is the real story of personal transformation. Actually saying, "this isn't me. I need to go find me. Who can help me stay focused on my journey?"

Tomorrow, we'll talk about how to actually do that and how Habitry does it, but right now I'm actually interested in hearing your story. 

**What is the story of the strongest thing you've ever done, and who was in your life that either supported or inspired that change?**

If you reply to this email with that story, I can 100% promise you I'll read it. Nothing inspires me more than stories of transformation and growth!

Until tomorrow,
Coach Stevo & the Habitry Team
